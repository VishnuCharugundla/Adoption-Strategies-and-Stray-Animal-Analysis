## 🌍 Project Overview

This project analyzes data from the Austin Animal Center to gain insights into animal intakes, outcomes, and stray animal locations. By identifying key factors that influence adoptions and strays, we aim to provide data-driven insights that can help improve adoption strategies and reduce stray cases in Austin.

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Identify key trends in animal intakes and outcomes.
* Analyze factors contributing to stray animal cases.
* Visualize the geographical distribution of stray animals.
* Develop data-driven recommendations to improve adoption rates and reduce stray populations.

## 👥 Team Members

* Dishant Bhansali
* Shashank Guda
* Vishnu Charugundla

## 📂 Dataset Description

The analysis is based on three datasets:

* **Intakes Dataset:** 📋 Contains information on animals brought into the shelter.
* **Outcomes Dataset:** 📊 Tracks adoption, return, or euthanasia outcomes.
* **Stray Map Dataset:** 🗺️ Provides geographic data on stray animal locations.

## 💻 Technologies Used

* Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, folium) 🐍
* Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
    * Handling missing values and duplicates. 🧹
    * Feature extraction and type conversions. ⚙️
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Distribution of intake/outcome types. 📊
    * Analysis of animal types, breeds, colors, and ages. 🐾
    * Geospatial mapping with Folium 🌍.
* **Correlation Analysis:**
    * Age at intake vs. outcome relationships 🔗.
* **Time Series Analysis:**
    * Monthly intake trends 📅.

## 🔑 Key Findings

* 🐕 Dogs (55%) and 🐈 cats (30%) dominate shelter populations.
* 🏙️ Urban areas show higher stray concentrations.
* 📈 Young animals have 40% higher adoption rates.
* ⚠️ 12% euthanasia rate linked to medical/behavioral issues.

## 📊 Visualizations

* Bar charts showing intake/outcome distributions. 📊
* Heatmaps of animal type outcomes 🔥.
* Folium maps of stray hotspots 🗺️.
* Time series plots of monthly intakes. 📅

## 💡 Actionable Insights

* 🎯 Breed-specific adoption campaigns.
* 📍 Geotargeted stray intervention programs.
* 🎁 Incentives for adopting older animals.
* 📢 Community education on microchipping.

## 🏆 Results & Recommendations

* High intake breeds need tailored marketing 🐾.
* Resource allocation based on intake conditions 💼.
* Real-time dashboard development for dynamic tracking 📲.

## 🚀 Future Work

* Predictive modeling for adoption probabilities 🤖.
* Enhanced geospatial tracking of strays 🛰️.
* Interactive shelter performance dashboard 📈.
